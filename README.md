# Workout-Guide

This is a visual display that guides you through all the different 
type of workouts that you wish to perform. It keeps track of the timing
required to complete one workout.
keeping time is not the only purpose of this web applicaiton.
It also shows you which workout is next and because you might loose track of that, and 
there is little time to think. With that you can then focus on only your workout
and not what's next.
